    <h4>C741 STATISTICS FOR DATA ANALYTICS STUDY RESOURCE</h4>

    <p>I wanted an easier way to view the information from the course so I created this website. The Models page
      contains not only the information in the book description (Models, Notation, etc.) but also contains important (to
      me) notes from the book as well as links to external resources obtained from Google searches or course
      documentation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If anyone is looking at this and is curious about putting mathematical equations into HTML code, I mostly used
      <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> which lets you use TeX, LaTEX, and MathML markup. Here is a <a
        href="http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/MathJaxDocumentation/TeXSyntax.htm#E"> link</a> to a resource that
      contains the TeX commands that are available in MathJax. There is also a much simpler method which, obviously,
      provides more simplistic results, an <a href="https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html">HTML
        unicode character list</a>.</p>
